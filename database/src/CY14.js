// the code is for Chiou and Youngs Ground Motion Model.
// it is coded by Pengfei Wang at UCLA on 7/27/2016. 
// 
// Variable
//m: Magnitude, moment magnitude
//T: array of interested periods, sec. 0 for PGA, -1 for PGV
//Rrup: closest distance to the rupture plane, km
//Rjb: Joyner-Boore distance, km
//Rx: horizontal distance from top of rupture, km
//depth: depth of top of fault, km
//dip: dip angle, deg
//lambda: Rake angle, deg
//Z10: basin depth, km; -999, if unknown
//Vs30: average velocity for upper 30m soil layer, m/s
//Fhw: hanging wall effect; 1 for hanging wall, 0 for footing wall
//FVS30: measurement method effects on Vs30; 1 for inferred from geology, 0 for measured
//region: California, Japan, China, Turkey, Italy, and Global (incl. Taiwan)
//d_DPP: DPP centered on the site and earthquake specific average DPP, 0 for median calc. 
//
//
//Output: PGA, PSA in g unit, PGV in cm/s

// Note: The input of T should be a vector, like [...], otherwise there will be some errors.
